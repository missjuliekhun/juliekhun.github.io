      <h2>We all started at 12 with HTML and CSS, right? No one told me that I can build upon my skills in this craft and turn it into a great career. When I learned about General Assembly through an email, I was excited to apply and see what I can do.The thought of learning more and making more to put my personal brand, and who I am really excited me. When the facebook takeover happened, I was honestly upset because there was no way for me to personal my space and add color. A new age came, and people lost their personalities, succumbing to likes on pictures, and instant gratification. How can I put myself out there in a way that really matters to me?</h2>
